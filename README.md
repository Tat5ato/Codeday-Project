# Codeday-Project
This particular Github will be devoid of several content because my project was something I built on a whim and as such, I didn't felt like there was a need to have a repository. 
Issues are the most I'll really have, since everything was saved on my computer. Also the internet was atrocious for me so having a window up would have delayed my project.
For about the 1st 3 or so hours, however, I was part of Srujan's group and as such, I have some affiliation with their Github, albeit not that much.
